# Code Improvements Made to archive-tar-external

## Security Improvements

1. **Command Injection Prevention**:
   - Added `shellwords` require and proper escaping of command arguments
   - Used `Open3.capture3` consistently for safer command execution
   - Added validation for tar options to prevent malicious input

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Complete stderr reading instead of just the first line
   - More descriptive error messages with exit status information
   - Proper error propagation for all failure cases

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **DRY Principle**:
   - Added private `execute_command` helper method to eliminate repeated error handling patterns
   - Consistent error handling across all methods

2. **Improved Compression Detection**:
   - Enhanced file extension detection for compressed archives
   - Added support for more compression formats (xz, lzma, etc.)
   - More reliable fallback mechanism

3. **Better Command Construction**:
   - Proper handling of shell glob patterns while maintaining security
   - Safer argument passing to external commands
   - Input validation for tar options

## Robustness Improvements

1. **Complete Error Information**:
   - Capture and report complete stderr output
   - Include exit status in error messages when stderr is empty
   - Better handling of edge cases

2. **More Reliable Operation**:
   - Proper handling of shell expansion for file patterns
   - Better compressed file detection
   - Improved command execution safety

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain full backward compatibility with the existing API. All existing tests pass without modification.

## Testing

All 36 existing tests continue to pass, ensuring that the improvements don't break existing functionality while making the code more secure and robust.
