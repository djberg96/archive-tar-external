== Description
  A simple tar & compress library that nicely wraps external system calls.

== Installation
  gem install archive-tar-external
   
== Synopsis
  require 'archive/tar/external'
  include Archive
   
  # The long way
  t = Tar::External.new('test.tar')
  t.create_archive('*.rb')
  t.compress_archive('gzip')
   
  # The short way
  t = Tar::External.new('test.tar', '*.rb', 'gzip')

== Prerequisites
  The win32-open3 library (MS Windows only).
  The 'tar' command line program.
  At least one compression program, e.g. gzip, bzip2, zip, etc.
   
== Known Issues
  The tar program that comes with Solaris will not raise an error if you
  try to expand a file from an archive that does not contain that file.

  If you come across any other issues, please report them on the project
  page at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/shards.
